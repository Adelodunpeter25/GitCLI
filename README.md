## Git Hooks Automation

GitCLI includes powerful Git hooks management to automate your workflow:

### Available Hook Templates

**Pre-commit Hooks:**
- Code Linting - Run linters before each commit
- Auto-formatting - Format code automatically
- Run Tests - Execute test suite before commit
- Block Debug Code - Prevent commits with debug statements

**Pre-push Hooks:**
- Run Full Test Suite - Ensure all tests pass before push
- Protect Main Branch - Prevent direct pushes to main/master
- Build Before Push - Verify project builds successfully

**Commit Message Hooks:**
- Conventional Commits - Enforce conventional commit format
- Minimum Message Length - Require descriptive messages
- Block WIP Commits - Prevent work-in-progress commits

**Post-commit Hooks:**
- Commit Notification - Get notified after each commit
- Auto Backup - Create automatic backups

### Using Hooks

```bash
# Open hooks management menu
gitcli hooks

# View installed hooks
gitcli list-hooks
```

Hooks are stored in `.git/hooks/` and configuration is saved in `.gitcli-hooks.json` for easy sharing with your team.

## Safety Features

- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Branch protection (can't delete current branch)
- Remote validation before push/pull
